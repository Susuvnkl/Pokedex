## Environment Setup

Before running the project, you need to set up the environment variables:

1. Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env` in the root directory.
2. Replace the placeholder values in `.env` with your actual environment-specific values. For example, set `VITE_BASE_URL` to the base URL of the API the project should use.
